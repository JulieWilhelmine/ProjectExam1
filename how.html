       <h2>Requirements</h2>
       <p>Being an astronaut is a real job and real people, like you, can apply for it!
        You can safely say though that there is no other job like it, and it's the only
        one that might take you off this very planet and back. Most of an astronauts
        time isn't spent in space though, but on Johnson's Space Centre in Houston,
        Texas, if you're hired by NASA. The day's won't ever be the same and you
        might be flying a jet one day, checking on supplies for the ISS the next,
        do speeches in elementary schools to get students exited about engineering
        and science, or spend the day 40 feet underwater in a heavy suit – testing
        things for future spacewalks. </p>

        <p>It is an amazing and unique job, but it is hard to get in. The odds are
         slighly above one-in-a-thousand, meaning that if NASA get's 6 000 applicants,
         they maybe hire 8 of them. </p>

        <p>As for pure requirements you need at least a bachelors degree in Engineering,
         Physical Science, Computer Science, Biological Science or Mathemathics.
         So if you have a passion for either of those fields of study, taking that route
         might get you closer to your astronaut dreams! Physical health is also important
         and to become an astronaut you need good eyesight, blood pressure within the normal
         range and to be in general good physical condition – so staying healthy is key!
         You can become an astronaut in many countries, but speaking english is a requirement,
         as the space station is international. </p>

      <h2>Training</h2>
      <p>As you can imagine, becoming an astronnaut requires a lot of training, and it can
        take up to 2 years to become fully qualified. Many hours will be spent flying training
        jets and learning the basics of the space shuttle and station. Since giving speeches
        is a big part of the job, public speaking classes is an important part of the training
        as well. There's also language classes to take, especially since the astronauts must be
        able to communicate with the Russian Mission Control Centre. </p>

      <p>Being in space can be very dangerous, so medical and survival training is very important
        so the astronauts are well prepared in case of emergency. There are life sized models of
        the space station where practice takes place – a smart way to test the conditions they're
        going to work in before actually going to space, since floating around in microgravity
        for example can be a bit hard to imagine before having tried it. A lot of training time
        is actually spent under water, as the change in gravity that portrays, as well as the
        pressures and lack of air can be a good way to simulate a space environment.</p>
