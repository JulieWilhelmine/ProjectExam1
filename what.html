     <h2>Where astronauts live</h2>
      <p>The International Space Station, or ISS, is a habitable sattelite orbiting Earth.
        It's first component reached orbit in 1998 and development and assembly is still
        a continuing project. It can often be seen from Earth as it's in what's called low orbit.
        Experiments are conducted in the microgravity and space environment research laboratory
        in many fields like biology, astronomy, physics, human biology and meterology.
        It completes 15.54 turnes around the Earth every day, moving at roughly 7,66 km/s.
        Imagine seeing 16 sunrises and sunsets per day! <p/>

        <p>The station is devided into two sections shared by many nations – the Russian Orbital
        Segment (ROS) and the United States Orbital Segment (USOS). There has been 8 space stations
        inhabited by crews before this one, but the ISS has been inhabited the longest – for 17 years! </p>

        <p>The countries participating on the ISS are Canada, Japan, Russia, the United States, Austria,
        Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland
        and the United Kingdom. It's said to be the most expensive item ever constructed, costing so
        many different countries billions of dollars every year! </p>

         <h2>A day on the ISS</h2>
         <p>A normal day at the ISS begins at 6:00 when the crew wakes up.
          After breakfast and a morning inspection of the station work begins at around 8:10.
          In general the crew works ten hour days on weekdays and five hours on Saturdays,
          with a one hour lunch break. Pre-sleep activities start at 19:30, including a crew
          conference and dinner. Sleep is scheduled from 21:30. When the astronauts don't work
          their time is their own for things like relaxing, maybe reading a book or skyping with
          family back on Earth?</p>

          <p>The crew members sleep in private quarters and it's important that these are well
          ventilated – if it's not, a bubble of their own carbon dioxide that they breathe out
          can be formed around an astronauts head and they can wake up gasping for air! </p>

          <p>It's possible to sleep floating freely to the station, but as you can imagine
          there's the risk of bumping into things, which is not very safe or good for
          the equipment, so the sleepingbags are securely fastened.</p>

          <h2>Eating in Space</h2>
          <p>The kitchen galley features a refrigerator, two food warmers and a water dispenser
          that provides both unheated and heated water. Ships arriving from Earth bring fresh
          fruit and vegetables, which is something the crew always looks forward to.
          Taste is redused in microgravity, so there is effort made to season the food for
          the astronauts more than one would in regular cooking.</p>

         <p>Most on the food on board is vacuum sealed in plastic bags and drinks and
          soups are always sipped from plastic bags with straws. When solid food is to be
          eaten magnets are used on the forks and knives so they won't float away – anything
          that floats away, even small crumbs, are important to remove as they might end up
          clogging air filters and doing other damage to the station or equipment.
          If you were to have a glass of orange juice in space you'd be given it as a dehydrated
          powder and would have to add water to consume it! </p>
