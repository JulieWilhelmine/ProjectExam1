     <h2>Yuri Gagarin</h2>
     <h3>First man in Space</h3>

     <p>Yuri, a Soviet pilot, was the first to complete an orbit of Earth in April 1961.
       The spacecraft, named Vostok, was rather small so it was good that Yuri was only
       1.57 meters tall. Upon launch Yuri exclaimed “poyekhali!“, meaning “let's go!”
       which later became a historical phrase to describe the beginning of the Space Age
       in human history. In 1968 he died in a jet crash.</p>

      <h3>First woman in Space</h3>

      <p>Valentina, a russian engineer and politician, was the first woman to travel
        to space, in 1963. She also became the first civillian to go to space,
        as everyone before her had been a part of the military. To this day she is
        the only woman to go on a solo space mission. It was her experience in skydiving
        – a hobby of hers, that led to her selection as a astronaut. She is still alive
        and well in Russia and says she would love to go to Mars,
        even if it's to be a one way trip. </p>

      <h2>Neil Armstrong</h2>
      <h3>First man on the Moon</h3>

      <p>In July 1969 an American aeronautical engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university
        professor named Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the Moon.
        It was he who said the famous words "That's one small step for (a) man, one giant
        leap for mankind." Neil was an eager Boy Scout and greeted the scouts when flying
        to the Moon, as well as carried a World Scout Badge with him there and back.
        He died after a surgery in 2012, 82 years old. </p>

      <h3>Second man on the Moon</h3>

      <p>The American engineer and Command Pilot in the United States Air Force, Buzz Aldrin,
        was the second man to set foot on the Moon, as a part of Neil Armstrong's crew in 1969.
        A religious man, Buzz consumed food and drink on the Moon, taking communion.
        His birth name was not Buzz, but when his sisters pronounced the word “brother” as “buzzer”
        he changed that to his legal name. Since 1985 he has worked on a special space flight
        path known as the Aldrin Cycler which uses less propellant than usual means.
        He is still working on it today, 88 years old. </p>
